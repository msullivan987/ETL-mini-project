Data Cleanup & Analysis

Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:


--The sources of data that you will extract from.


--The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).


--The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).


--The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.

--Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).


--Transform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.


--Load: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
